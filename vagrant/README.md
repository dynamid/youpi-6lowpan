# Make firefox & Copper working

* run it with the command `firefoxCopper`

Before you can use them : you need to **restart firefox**. So first time you start it it will NOT work, just restart and it is ok (firefox configure the app when it start)

# Make uniflash working

uniflash is not working on the VM. You should install it and flash from the host. You can use the `~/synced-folder` to move `.hex` file from the VM to the host.

You can find how to install and use it in the [CC2650 documentation](../docs/CC2650)
